        {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Where was it played?"}
    ]
)

##â€¢# Extract assistant's reply
assistant_reply = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']

### Example Chat Completions API call with JSON mode
response_json_mode = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106",
    response_format={"type": "json_object"},
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant designed to output JSON."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"}
    ]
)

### Extract assistant's reply in JSON mode
assistant_reply_json_mode = response_json_mode.choices[0].message.content

### Example Completions API call
response_completions = client.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct",
    prompt="Write a tagline for an ice cream shop."
)

### Extract completions API response
ice_cream_tagline = response_completions['choices'][0]['text']

### Collaborative Resolution
